# Task
A test assignment from one of the companies. 
Task: to develop a program that modifies files.
1) After the launch, the user configures:
a) the mask of the input files,
b) delete the input or not
c) the path to the output files
d) actions when repeating the output file name:
i) overwriting
ii) modification, if yes, then, for example, a counter to the name
e) the frequency of polling the presence of the input file (timer)
f) timer operation or one-time start
g) the law (mask) of file modification

2) Functionality: modifies input files, for example, an XOR operation with an 8-byte variable entered from the form (Point 1,g)
3) Protection from "fool": if the input file is not closed, do not touch it.
